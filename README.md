This MTZIPBenchGUI is a lightweight native Win32 C++ application that provides a graphical interface for compressing and decompressing arbitrary files on Windows. It uses zlib and libdeflate to implement both single-threaded and multithreaded chunked compression, then reports throughput and file-size metrics for comparison. Written with the Win32 API in Visual Studio and compiled via the MSVC toolchain, it demonstrates fundamental file I/O, overlapping I/O, and multithreading techniques in a GUI setting. Tested on Windows 7/8/10/11.

This tool is not just a compressor, but also a learning aid‚Äîhelping developers understand the mechanics of chunked compression, synchronization (bounded queues), and progress reporting in a Win32 desktop application.

## Features

* **File Selection** via the native Windows Open File dialog
* **Chunk Size (MiB)** input for flexible compression granularity
* **Single-Threaded Compression** using zlib (`compress2`)
* **Multithreaded Compression** using zlib for each chunk and merging results
* **Multithreaded Decompression** using libdeflate in parallel with overlapped I/O
* **Progress Bar** that updates per-chunk during compress/decompress
* **Results Panel** showing execution time, output file sizes, and speedup factor
* **Fixed-Size GUI** (non-resizable) for simplicity
* **Minimal dependencies**: only Win32 API, zlib, libdeflate

## Requirements

* Windows OS (7, 8, 10, or 11)
* Visual Studio 2019/2022 (MSVC toolchain)
* zlib development headers and library (`zlib.lib`)
* libdeflate development headers and static library (`deflatestatic.lib`)
* Windows SDK (headers for Win32 API)

## Build Instructions

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MULTITHREADED-FILE-COMPRESSION-TOOL.git
   cd MULTITHREADED-FILE-COMPRESSION-TOOL
   ```
2. **Ensure the following folders and files exist under the project root:**

   ```text
   third_party\zlib\include
   third_party\zlib\lib\zlib.lib
   third_party\libdeflate\include
   third_party\libdeflate\lib\deflatestatic.lib
   ```
3. **Open a x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022 and run:**

   ```bat
   cl.exe /EHsc /std:c++17 /Ithird_party\libdeflate\include /Ithird_party\zlib\include ^
       src\mTZIDBench.cpp ^
       third_party\libdeflate\lib\deflatestatic.lib ^
       third_party\zlib\lib\zlib.lib ^
       User32.lib Comctl32.lib Comdlg32.lib Gdi32.lib ^
       /link /MACHINE:X64 /OUT:MTZIPBenchGUI.exe
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch `MTZIPBenchGUI.exe`.
2. Click **Select File‚Ä¶** and choose any file (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.mp4`, etc.).
3. If the selected file does not end in `.mtz`, the **Compress** button is enabled. Otherwise, **Decompress** is enabled.
4. Enter a chunk size (in **MiB**) into the **"Chunk size (MiB)"** field (default is 4).
5. Click **Compress** to run single-threaded then multithreaded compression. The progress bar updates per chunk; when finished, results appear in the lower panel.
6. Click **Decompress** on any `.mtz` file to restore the original file. The progress bar will update, and timing/size results display once done.

## Code Overview

### `src/mTZIDBench.cpp`

* **WinMain(...)**

  * Registers window class
  * Creates main window
  * Enters message loop

* **WndProc(...)**

  * Handles window messages
  * Creates controls
  * Processes `WM_COMMAND` for Select/Compress/Decompress
  * Updates progress and results

* **`compress_file_singlethread_cb(...)`**

  * Reads input, writes header
  * Compresses each chunk serially with zlib
  * Writes compressed data
  * Writes header (magic, chunk size, original size, number of chunks, compressed-size table)

* **`compress_file_multithread_cb(...)`**

  * Same header layout
  * Spawns threads (limited by hardware concurrency) to compress chunks in parallel
  * Uses a counting semaphore to bound in-flight jobs and a mutex to serialize writes to the output file

* **`decompress_file_multithread_cb(...)`**

  * Opens `.mtz` header via `CreateFileW`
  * Reads embedded filename, magic, chunk size, original size, and per-chunk compressed sizes
  * Spawns one reader thread that issues overlapped `ReadFile` calls to fetch each compressed chunk and pushes them into a bounded queue
  * Worker threads pop chunks, decompress via libdeflate, and write them into a shared buffer
  * Finally, writes the fully assembled original file

* **`CompressWorker(...)`** and **`DecompressWorker(...)`**

  * Thread entry points that call the above C-style APIs
  * Record timings, get output-file sizes
  * Post results back to the GUI via custom `WM_APP_` messages

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Known Limitations

* No encryption or password protection.
* No drag-and-drop support or ‚ÄúSave As‚Äù dialog.
* Window is fixed-size and uses basic Win32 controls only.
* No support for pausing/canceling in-flight operations.
* Compression ratio on already-compressed files (e.g., MP4, MP3) will be minimal.

### Possible Enhancements

* Add support for additional compression codecs (LZ4, Brotli, etc.).
* Implement a **Cancel** button to stop compression/decompression mid-stream.
* Enable drag-and-drop of files onto the main window.
* Support resizable layout and DPI scaling.
* Add real-time charts comparing throughput over time.

üìå **MTZIPBenchGUI** is ideal for developers exploring parallel compression, overlapped I/O, and chunked-stream processing on Windows. It serves as both a practical GUI tool and an educational example for native Win32 multithreaded applications.
